# Project general coding standards

## Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for component names, interfaces, and type aliases
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants

## Error Handling
- Use try/catch blocks for async operations
- Implement proper error boundaries in React components
- Always log errors with contextual information

## Code Structure
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Keep functions and methods short and focused
- Use meaningful comments to explain complex logic
- Organize files and folders by feature or module
- Make comments for all functions and classes
- Put each class or component in its own file
- Use react-router v7+
